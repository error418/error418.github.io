When writing [Swingletree](https://github.com/error418/swingletree) I came across [InversifyJS](inversify), which enables us
to use Dependency Injection in our TypeScript applications. The refactor-hammer was more than ready to be swung, as soon as I discovered that constructor injection is supported and almost everything is managed via annotations.
