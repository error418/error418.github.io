*"Just set up a [PiHole][pihole] and look, what is going on"*. Since my home is not massively IOT'ized I didn't suspect much traffic going to analytic servers; but a relatively free weekend offered the opportunity for a small side-project.

## Easy going

The setup is very simple. In my case I used a spare Raspberry PI 1 with a 2GB SD card and flashed the latest [Raspbian Lite][raspbian] image.

In case your Raspberry is running headless: Put an empty file named `ssh` on the SD card after writing the image. The system will then be configured to accept SSH connections.

Just update everything and you will be ready to install pihole

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

pihole offers a simple installation method. 

```
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

Simplicity is great, but be careful, if you install things this way. It is always a good idea to check what the script does before executing it.

You will now be guided through a setup wizard and at the end of it you will have a fully configured pihole. Be sure to note the generated admin password and set your pi up to use a static ip address.
